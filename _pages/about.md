My primary research agenda is to develop a mathematical characterization of machine learning~(ML) models,
their learning/training behavior and the associated precision achieved by them.
Towards this end, I study the two broad facets of ML: theory; through the eyes of tools from systems theory, statistics and  optimization; and applied; 
by building AI/ML models to solve key problems in nuclear physics, material science, HPC and more recently climate.

I love rock climbing and cycling.  My favorite books include fantasy fiction and science. 


Favorite fantasy fiction serries is <a href='https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen'>Malazan Book of the Fallen</a> by Steven Errikson

My favorite science book is  <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/feb/07/wonders-life-physicist-revolution-biology'> What is Life?</a> by Erwin Schr√∂dinger.
